**DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS**

Data structure is a way of organizing data to use it effectively and algorithms are the ways to solve problems optimally.
I have created this repository to learn and implement data structures and algorithms in problem solving.

Below are the data structures and algorithms added to this repository.

**ARRAYS**
An array is a collection of homogeneous items stored in a contiguous memory location.
Array index starts with 0 and should be declared with definite size.
Below are the problems solved in arrays.
