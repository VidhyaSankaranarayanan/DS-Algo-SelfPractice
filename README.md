**DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS**

Data structure is a way of organizing data to use it effectively. Algorithms are the ways to solve problems optimally.
I have created this repository to learn and implement data structures and algorithms in problem solving.

Below are the data structures and algorithms added to this repository.
