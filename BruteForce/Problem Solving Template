/*
	 * 	1) Did I understand the problem? 
	 * 		-> If No, Ask the person to provide more detail with examples
	 * 		-> If yes, go to Next step
	 * 		
	 * 		What is the input? 
	 * 		What is the expected output?
	 * 		Do I have constraints to solve the problem? 
	 * 		Do I have all information to go to next step? 
	 * 		How big is your test data set will be? 
	 * 
	 *  2) Test Data set
	 *  
	 *  	Minimum of 3 data sets - Positive, Edge, Negative
	 *  	Validate with the interviewer if the data set is fine by his/her assumptions
	 *  
	 *   3) Do I know how to solve it? 
	 *   
	 *   	Yes - great is there an alternate solution?
	 *   	No - Can I break down the problem into sub problems?
	 *   
	 *   4) Ask for hint (if you do not know how to solve it)
	 *   
	 *   5) Do I know alternate solutions as well? 
	 *   
	 *   	Yes - What are those?
	 *   	No - That is still fine, proceed to solve what you know
	 *   
	 *   6) If you know the alternate solutions -> find out the O notations (performance)
	 *   
	 *    	Then, explain either both or the best (depends on the time)
	 *    
	 *    	Approach 1: Start with the worst -> Improve (Optimize) -> End up with the best 
	 *    	Approach 2: Write down the options and benefits and code the best 
	 *    
	 *   7) Start always with the Pseudo code 
	 *   
	 *   8) Implement them in the code (editor)
	 *   
	 *   9) Test against the different data set
	 *   
	 *   10) If it fails, debug them to solve it
